### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Abdul**](https://abdulr.dev), a software engineer from Pakistan.

I currently work as a freelance developer, helping startups and teams bring their ideas to life through modern UIs, integrations, and scalable backend systems. I'm a long-term contributor at [**@TheCampStack**](https://github.com/thecampstack), where I focus on building recommendation engines, custom workflows and developer tooling. Previously I was at [**@myTpen**](https://mytpen.app) and [**@Ability Beyond**](https://abilitybeyond.org) on data-driven platforms and automation tools.

My work spans across building workflows that handle +10,000 of monthly invocations to designing user-facing features in high-traffic environments. I’m especially drawn to systems that blend product thinking with deep technical execution.

Outside of work, I’m a curious mind—following science, experimenting with motion design, playing video games, and working toward building a meaningful online presence.
